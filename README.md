# Projet 14 : Pass a jQuery library to React

### Sc√©nario :

WealthHealt is a company that uses an internal web application, called HRnet, which manages employee records. The app is old and uses jQuery on the front end, which leads to massive bugs and increased internal complaints. 

### Mission :

- Convert the entire HRNet project to React. 
- Convert one of the four current jQuery plugins to React. Replace the remaining 3 jQuery plugins with React components. 
- Perform Lighthouse benchmarks comparing the old and new app. 

#### Conversion du projet HRNet

- Make a new version of the "Create Employee" and "Employee List" pages with React.
- Add a state management system (the current version uses local storage).
- Make sure that everything is consistent in terms of style.
- Test the React code with a unit test suite. Otherwise, only manual testing is necessary.

#### Plugin conversion

Here is the list of currently used jQuery plugins that need to be converted: 

- Date picker plugin
- Modal window plugin - jQuery.modal.js
- Drop-down menus
- Plugin for data tables

#### Performance testing

- Measure quantifiable data (e.g. page load times, network calls) to ensure that converting the app to React actually improves performance. For that, do well Lighthouse performance audits.
